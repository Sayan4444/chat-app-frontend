**In this whole docs chat refers to Chat Model and message to the Message Model

Models

1. We have two models Chat & Message
2. Chat-> It stores the members doing a chat. For example if we are doing a group chat . Chat model is responsible to store the MEMBERS of the group, name of the admin and the name of the group
3. Message-> It actually stores the message and name of the sender who sent the message

Controllers

/api/chat(POST)-> This gives you all the 1-2-1 chats for the logged in user
/api/chat/group(POST)-> Create a new group
/api/chat/group(DELETE)-> Delete an exsisting group
